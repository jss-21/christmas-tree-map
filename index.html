    <!-- STORY -->

<div>

  <p>You might be imagining the crowds in Dyker Heights in Brooklyn gawking at over-the-top light displays. But this borough is not the top contender when it comes to quantities of Christmas trees, according to data from the Department of Sanitation (DSNY).</p>

  <p>Each January, after packing up ornaments and twinkling string lights for the season, New Yorkers ditch their dried-up Christmas trees on the side of the street. Sanitation workers pick up these evergreens in dedicated garbage trucks that the DSNY’s press secretary Vincent Gragnani describes as “the best-smelling collection trucks in the city.”</p>

  <p>“According to DSNY’s most recent data, Manhattan is home to the highest density of Christmas trees in New York City. In January 2021, DSNY collected a total of 393.5 tons of trees from the borough’s curbs, which equals 46.5 pounds per 100 residents — about half a pound per person. </p>

  <p>On the other end of the spectrum, Bronx residents left the least amount of trees per capita on their curbs last holiday season, with about 12 pounds per 100 residents — just over one-tenth of a pound per person. The third-most populous borough, according to the 2020 census, the Bronx ranked fourth terms of total tree tonnage.</p>

  <p>The city’s least populous borough, Staten Island, unsurprisingly generated the least total tree tonnage. But per capita, the borough ranked second in terms of Christmas trees collected by DSNY per capita.</p>


  <p>“Based on those tonnage numbers, we estimate that we collect roughly 200,000 trees each January,” Gragnani wrote in an email. The collection trucks are weighed as they enter and exit the city’s transfer stations, the same way municipal waste and recycling is measured, and then taken to either DSNY’s Staten Island compost facility or facilities in other boroughs run by community partners. There, the trees are chipped, combined with leaves, and mixed into compost for city parks and gardens.</p>

  <p>At their annual Mulchfest event last holiday season, the Parks Department collected an additional 29,000 trees or so in parks in each borough, where New Yorkers could haul their trees, instead of leaving them on the curb. These trees were chipped and turned into mulch for city parks and gardens. The trees from this Parks Department program, however, are not included in the Department of Sanitation’s data.</p>

  <p><i>Want to dispose of your Christmas tree? Depending on the weather, curbside Christmas tree pickup is expected to run from Jan. 6, 2022 through Jan. 15. Mulchfest sites will be open for drop-off from Dec. 26 through Jan. 9 during park hours.</i></p>
